# S24_Spam_Detector

## Introduction
Spam Detector offers a secure and transparent environment for email and message exchanges, protecting users against cyber threats like phishing and information leaks. Our platform introduces a unique token-based incentive system, encouraging active participation in message system security and platform improvement efforts.

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Security

Automated AI scanning of messages to detect potential threats, ensuring your communications stay private and secure. Instant identification of phishing attempts and malicious content, with automatic alerts to keep you informed. Adjustable filtering capabilities, allowing for personalized security settings through black and white lists.

### Blockchain-Enhanced Privacy

Our system combines blockchain technology's security with a community-driven approach to ensure secure and private communications. It features encrypted, decentralized messaging to prevent unauthorized access. Membership is community-vetted, with entry through voting, security deposits, or referrals. To combat spam and malicious content, the system records details of suspicious activities on the blockchain, encouraging user vigilance. Users reporting harmful information receive financial rewards, ensuring a proactive, protected community. This creates a secure, transparent communication platform that guards against data tampering and supports whistleblower anonymity.

### Token Rewards System

Whenever users decide to check suspicious messages, they will be charged a nominal token fee. This charge assists in covering the network's operational expenses and incentivizes users who play an active role in identifying suspicious activities. Additionally, by applying a small fee for such reports, it deters the system from being swamped with non-serious claims, ensuring that only genuine concerns are raised.
Users can earn tokens by actively participating in the platform, such as identifying suspicious activities or contributing to community discussions. Tokens can also be awarded for helping to verify the safety of links or messages, enhancing the collective security of the platform. Specifically, a new member must be referenced by an existing member with a fixed amount of token. If a group of the harmful message sender is detected by our Al model. A group of people who reference in the group will be put into the blacklist to protect the community safety. Specifically, by controlling the members in the community, we can prevent malicious voting from happening. 

### Community Governance

A distributed governance model that empowers users to vote on important decisions, including the admission of new members. Contribute to the platform's development and security protocols through active participation and feedback. Engage with a community of like-minded individuals committed to maintaining a secure and private digital communication space.
